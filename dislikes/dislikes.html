                        God gave us talents to share with others, lifting up those around us, sharing his
                        love through them. Nevertheless, “it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has
                        strength” (Mos. 4:27).

                    <p>Enthusiasm alone can only take you so far. Pushing bad technique continuously
                        will destroy your vocal chords and hurt our ears along the way. Take your time and don't try too
                        hard to replicate famous singers. Improve instead.

                        Beans are my least favorite food. The mushy texture and dirt flavored combination
                        makes me sick to my stomach.

                    <p>
                        I discovered beans don't like me either, so I'm glad we have at least
                        one thing in common. Put them on the side or don’t include them at all if we’re eating together.
