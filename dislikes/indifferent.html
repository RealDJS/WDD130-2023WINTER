                        As an ignorant individual that can’t recognize or name any song by George Straight, I ask
                        this: If the singer has no accent, does it count as country? Are they are a
                        part of the genre or just done to appeal to their audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since every song is about trucks, driving down dirt roads, jeans, breaking up with someone
                        they haven’t dated, and losing their dog, I think country is just emo music for farmers

                        I wish they used this movie's tech to make fake documentaries about Pandora like Planet Earth
                        and The Blue Planet, giving us time to admire the wildlife they created, making this world
                        seem natural and explorable.

                    <p>
                        Instead of giving us a story with supportive world building, they cheaply copy and pasted Dances
                        with Wolves with 20 ft tall intergalactic smurfs, creating a film no one remembered or watched
                        again until the sequel was coming out.

                        I couldn’t name a song or member of this band if my life depended on it. All I know is my
                        cousins and every other high-school girl is obsessed with them

                        A friend showing me Gangnam Style a decade ago will be the deepest I ever get into K-Pop.
