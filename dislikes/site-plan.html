        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This website gives everyone access to my blacklisted topics, keeping conversations civil and enjoyable.
            Now
            there is no excuse for people to not know what to talk about around me, avoiding disagreement and debate
        </p>
        <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My target audience is people who want to talk to me, but don't know what to say. This makes me MORE
            approachable than before, making way for wonderful dialogue between us. People would NEVER use this
            website
            as a source of how to best annoy or infuriate me.</p> <!-- change this -->

        <p>
            This site will tell people what I don’t care about or dislike, requiring visitors to do lots of reading.
            This will be the best website on this topic because no other site holds all this information. Consider this
            an index or blog on my thoughts and opinions, making you aware of where I stand when you talk with me. Take
            this with a grain of salt and hyperbole.

            The site is divided accordingly between my Dislikes and Indifferences. Links are in the nav above and the
            previous sentence

        <h3>Dislike</h3>
        <p>
            Beans
            Beans are my least favorite food. The mushy texture and dirt flavored combination makes me sick to my
            stomach. I discovered beans don't like me either, so I'm glad we have at least one thing in common.
            Put them on the side or don’t include them at all if we’re eating together.

            Bad A Capella
            God gave us talents to share with others, lifting up those around us, sharing his love through them.
            Nevertheless, “it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength” (Mos. 4:27). The songs
            in Pitch Perfect were fun, but enthusiasm alone can take you so far. Start your group simply and slowly with
            easier music, slowly building up to complex and dynamic tunes. If they cannot proficiently sing slow, then
            they can’t sing fast. If a song requires a soprano to sing up to F4, and they can barely hit E4 without
            screeching, then you need to choose a new song. Keep it simple. Work on progressing as a group instead of
            trying to replicate viral/famous pieces without their refinement and experience.

        <h3>Indifferent</h3>
        <p>
            Country Music
            I don’t normally listen to music in my free time. I may run into a cover I like on youtube, save it in my
            playlist, and forget about it until it comes up on shuffle during a roadtrip or while cleaning the
            apartment. As an ignorant individual that can’t recognize or name any song by George Straight, I ask this:
            If the singer has no accent, does it count as country? Some of these inflections are faker than the New York
            Times’ Best Sellers List, making me wonder if they are necessarily a part of the genre or just done to
            appeal to their audience. Since every song is about trucks, driving down dirt roads, jeans, breaking up with
            someone they haven’t dated, and losing their dog, I think country is just emo music for farmers.

            BTS
            I couldn’t name a song or member of this band if my life depended on it. All I know is my cousins and
            everyone other high-school girl are obsessed with them. A friend showing me Gangnam Style a decade ago will
            be the deepest I ever get into K-Pop.

            Avatar & Avatar 2: The Way of Water
            These movies have no purpose besides showing pretty CGI colors because James Cameron forgot how to make good
            movies. I wish they used this tech to make fake documentaries about Pandora like Planet Earth and The Blue
            Planet, giving me time time to admire the wildlife they created, making this world seem natural and
            explorable. Instead of giving us a story with supportive world building, they cheaply copy and pasted Dances
            with Wolves with 20 ft tall intergalactic smurfs, creating a film no one remembered or watched again until
            the sequel was coming out.
